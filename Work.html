    <h6>object. is a lifestyle brand created around the idea that a product only has meaning in the context of a person using
        it. The first product, object.01, is designed specifically to fit in the many contexts of the independent worker.
        It has three primary features: a compartment for work essentials, a compartment for personal items, It also has a
        modular style that shifts between backpack and briefcase. object.01 transitions seamlessly from coffee shops to client
        meetings and everywhere in between.
