    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <p>I've assembled a collection of academic and professional work that I believe best 
        reflects my skills. Please have a look below.

            <p>object. is a lifestyle brand created around the idea that a product only has meaning in the context of a person
                using it. The first product, object.01, is designed specifically to fit in the many contexts of the independent
                worker. It has three primary features: a compartment for work essentials, a compartment for personal items,
                It also has a modular style that shifts between backpack and briefcase. object.01 transitions seamlessly
                from coffee shops to client meetings and everywhere in between.

            <p>In the summer of 2016, I worked for the software design and development consultancy projekt202. During my tenure,
                I had the opportunity to co-lead ethnographic research and experience strategy for a global computer hardware
                manufacturer with annual revenues of over $50 billion.
