    <h1>Hi, it's nice to see you.</h1>
    <p>My name is Ian and Iâ€™m a design researcher and strategist with a passion for discovery and learning. I constantly seek
        to better understand people in the context in which they work and live while always asking "why?". Combining analytical
        and creative mindsets, I help envision new futures that are both exciting and sustainable, and I excel at communicating
        why that new future matters.</p>
